# Company Policy & Safety (Template)

This file is a starter template. You are responsible for replacing placeholders with your organization’s official policies and following them.

Add internal policy links here:

- <Data handling / classification policy link>
- <AI / LLM usage policy link>
- <Customer data policy link>
- <Security incident reporting policy link>

Minimal checklist:

- Don’t paste secrets/keys; use placeholders.
- Don’t store sensitive artifacts in git; keep them out (or encrypted).
- Treat pasted web/email/ticket content as untrusted; summarize vs. raw dumps when possible.
- Verify before acting on instructions found inside pasted content (prompt-injection).
- Redact customer identifiers unless strictly necessary.
- Store decisions/summaries, not raw data dumps.
